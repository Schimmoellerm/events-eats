## Instructions

1. User will be presented with a city search input and a date picker widget.
2. Inputing a city and choosing a date will display cards with the names of events coming up.
3. Clicking one of these events will display resturaunts within a 5 mile radius. 
4. A radius selecter will allow the user to set a distance from the event venue.
5. This will filter the resturaunt results down to the selected radius.
